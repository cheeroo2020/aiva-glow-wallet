# AI Suggestion Component (Lovable UI)

## Purpose
A clean, friendly component that shows FX suggestions generated by GPT — helping users decide the best time to convert currencies.

## Function
- Shows GPT's FX recommendation (e.g., "Now is a good time to convert USD to AUD").
- Highlights trend confidence (e.g., Strong, Neutral, Weak).
- Button: "Explain" — to expand the GPT reasoning.

## Placement
Appears under the FX conversion module in the wallet UI.

## Interaction
- When user taps “AI Assist”, this card pops up.
- Can be dismissed or expanded.

## Notes
This is just the UX placeholder. Actual GPT logic is handled in the `/ai/` folder.
