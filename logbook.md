### üìÖ 7 August 2025

**Task ID:** AIVA-11  
**Title:** Test FX trend data with GPT response  
**Epic:** Smart FX AI Engine  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed  

---

#### üß† Objective  
Implement a Python script that reads mock FX rate data, detects 7-day trends, and outputs Smart FX-style conversion recommendations for selected currency pairs.

---

#### ‚úÖ Steps Completed

1. Opened AIVA-11 task to analyse FX trend using GPT-style logic.
2. Created directory structure:  
   - `fx_data/` for storing JSON rate files  
   - `ai/` for placing Python analysis scripts  
3. Created `fxrates.json` using 7-day sample data manually inside `fx_data/`.
4. Wrote `fx_trend_analysis.py` in `ai/` to:
   - Read `fxrates.json`
   - Extract currency pair values
   - Analyse whether the trend was rising, falling, or stable
   - Generate natural language suggestions
5. Ran into the following **issues** and fixed them step-by-step:

#### üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting and Fixes

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix |
|------|------------|-----|
| `cd path/to/your/aiva-glow-wallet` fails | Placeholder path not replaced | Used actual local repo path (`~/Desktop/aiva-glow-wallet`) |
| `FileNotFoundError` on `fxrates.json` | File didn‚Äôt exist yet | Created file using `touch fx_data/fxrates.json` |
| `fxrates.json` not found again | Wrong relative path | Ensured it was located inside `fx_data/` and referenced correctly from `ai/` |
| KeyError: `'USD_AUD'` | Tried to access pair as top-level key | Realised JSON had dates as top-level keys, each containing pairs |
| IndentationError after `for` loop | Block not indented | Properly indented the loop block |
| Confusion on logic order | Was unclear how each part connects | Broke into smaller debug/test steps |
| Added `"AUD_USD"` to pair list | This key doesn‚Äôt exist in JSON | Handled missing data gracefully with fallback logic |

---

---

## üìÖ 9 August 2025  
**Task ID:** AIVA-14  
**Title:** Add trend logic to determine convert/wait  
**Epic:** FX Data & API Layer  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed  

---

### üß† Objective  
Add percentage-based threshold logic to the FX trend analysis so the AI can recommend either "Convert Now" or "Wait" depending on market movement size.

---

### üóÇ Step-by-Step Process  

1. **Reviewed yesterday‚Äôs progress** from AIVA-13 & AIVA-11 to ensure base FX analysis logic was ready.  
2. **Created `fx_trend_with_threshold.py`** in `/ai/`.  
3. **Set threshold logic**:  
   - If drop ‚â• threshold ‚Üí **Convert Now**  
   - If small movement ‚Üí **Wait**  
4. **Initial run failed**:  
   - Reason: Python could not find script (`No such file or directory`)  
   - Cause: Repo had been moved from `Desktop` to `Documents/GitHub/`  
   - Fix: Navigated to correct path in terminal (`cd ~/Documents/GitHub/aiva-glow-wallet`)  
5. **File not found error for script**:  
   - Cause: File still in old Desktop folder  
   - Fix: Moved file into `/ai/` inside repo  
6. **Tested script with mock data** in `/fx_data/fxrates.json`.  
7. **Observed missing AUD_USD data**:  
   - Added graceful handling with `"N/A"` output to avoid crash.  

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Table  

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix |
|-------|------------|-----|
| Script not found | Running in wrong directory | Navigated to repo folder in Documents |
| Python path error | File created outside repo | Moved script into correct `/ai/` directory |
| Missing AUD_USD key | Not present in fxrates.json | Added "N/A" handling logic |

---

### üì∏ Output Screenshot  
Stored as `/screenshots/screenshot_aiva14_threshold_output.png`:

USD_AUD: falling (-1.32%) ‚Üí Convert Now | USD weakening vs AUD | Consider holding AUD

EUR_AUD: falling (-3.01%) ‚Üí Convert Now | EUR weakening vs AUD | Consider holding AUD

AUD_USD: N/A (data missing) ‚Üí Hold position



---

### üîÅ Next Steps  
- Integrate threshold logic into Smart FX UI  
- Begin AIVA-15 to simulate FX conversions with mock balances  

---

### üìå Commit Info  

**Commit Message:**  
`AIVA-14: Added FX threshold logic for convert/wait decisions`  
 
**Commit Description:**

## üìÖ 11 August 2025  
**Task ID:** AIVA-14 (Enhancement)  
**Title:** Enhance FX trend analysis with debug output & flexible threshold input  
**Epic:** FX Data & API Layer  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed  

---

### üß† Objective  
Improve the FX trend analysis script (`fx_trend_with_threshold.py`) to make it easier to debug, test, and adjust decision logic by adding detailed printouts and a variable threshold via CLI.

---

### üóÇ Step-by-Step Process  

1. **Reviewed** previous implementation of `fx_trend_with_threshold.py` from 9 August.  
2. **Added debug prints**:  
   - Data type (`OrderedDict`)  
   - List of available dates  
   - Sample day values with currency pairs and rates  
3. **Printed full currency series** for each pair with a flag indicating if any days are missing.  
4. **Allowed CLI argument** to set decision threshold:  
   - Example: `python3 ai/fx_trend_with_threshold.py 0.5` for 0.5% threshold  
   - Defaults to 1.0% if not specified.  
5. **Formatted outputs** to clearly show:  
   - Currency pair  
   - Trend direction & % change  
   - Decision: "Convert Now", "Wait", or "Hold position"  
6. **Tested script** with thresholds 0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.0% to confirm dynamic behaviour.  

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Table  

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix |
|-------|------------|-----|
| `zsh: number expected` error | CLI threshold argument incorrectly formatted | Ensured correct float input and tested valid syntax |
| Output unclear for debugging | Script only showed final suggestions | Added print statements before decision logic |

---

### üì∏ Output Screenshot  
**Filename:** `fx_trend_debug_threshold_tests.png`  
**Location:** `/screenshots/`  
**Description:** Shows three runs of the script with thresholds of 1.0%, 0.5%, and 2.0%, including debug details.
