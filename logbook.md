### üìÖ 7 August 2025

**Task ID:** AIVA-11  
**Title:** Test FX trend data with GPT response  
**Epic:** Smart FX AI Engine  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed  

---

#### üß† Objective  
Implement a Python script that reads mock FX rate data, detects 7-day trends, and outputs Smart FX-style conversion recommendations for selected currency pairs.

---

#### ‚úÖ Steps Completed

1. Opened AIVA-11 task to analyse FX trend using GPT-style logic.
2. Created directory structure:  
   - `fx_data/` for storing JSON rate files  
   - `ai/` for placing Python analysis scripts  
3. Created `fxrates.json` using 7-day sample data manually inside `fx_data/`.
4. Wrote `fx_trend_analysis.py` in `ai/` to:
   - Read `fxrates.json`
   - Extract currency pair values
   - Analyse whether the trend was rising, falling, or stable
   - Generate natural language suggestions
5. Ran into the following **issues** and fixed them step-by-step:

#### üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting and Fixes

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix |
|------|------------|-----|
| `cd path/to/your/aiva-glow-wallet` fails | Placeholder path not replaced | Used actual local repo path (`~/Desktop/aiva-glow-wallet`) |
| `FileNotFoundError` on `fxrates.json` | File didn‚Äôt exist yet | Created file using `touch fx_data/fxrates.json` |
| `fxrates.json` not found again | Wrong relative path | Ensured it was located inside `fx_data/` and referenced correctly from `ai/` |
| KeyError: `'USD_AUD'` | Tried to access pair as top-level key | Realised JSON had dates as top-level keys, each containing pairs |
| IndentationError after `for` loop | Block not indented | Properly indented the loop block |
| Confusion on logic order | Was unclear how each part connects | Broke into smaller debug/test steps |
| Added `"AUD_USD"` to pair list | This key doesn‚Äôt exist in JSON | Handled missing data gracefully with fallback logic |
