**Task ID:** AIVA-11  
**Title:** Test FX trend data with GPT response  
**Epic:** Smart FX AI Engine  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed  

---

#### üß† Objective  
Implement a Python script that reads mock FX rate data, detects 7-day trends, and outputs Smart FX-style conversion recommendations for selected currency pairs.

---

#### ‚úÖ Steps Completed

1. Opened AIVA-11 task to analyse FX trend using GPT-style logic.
2. Created directory structure:  
   - `fx_data/` for storing JSON rate files  
   - `ai/` for placing Python analysis scripts  
3. Created `fxrates.json` using 7-day sample data manually inside `fx_data/`.
4. Wrote `fx_trend_analysis.py` in `ai/` to:
   - Read `fxrates.json`
   - Extract currency pair values
   - Analyse whether the trend was rising, falling, or stable
   - Generate natural language suggestions
5. Ran into the following **issues** and fixed them step-by-step:

#### üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting and Fixes

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix |
|------|------------|-----|
| `cd path/to/your/aiva-glow-wallet` fails | Placeholder path not replaced | Used actual local repo path (`~/Desktop/aiva-glow-wallet`) |
| `FileNotFoundError` on `fxrates.json` | File didn‚Äôt exist yet | Created file using `touch fx_data/fxrates.json` |
| `fxrates.json` not found again | Wrong relative path | Ensured it was located inside `fx_data/` and referenced correctly from `ai/` |
| KeyError: `'USD_AUD'` | Tried to access pair as top-level key | Realised JSON had dates as top-level keys, each containing pairs |
| IndentationError after `for` loop | Block not indented | Properly indented the loop block |
| Confusion on logic order | Was unclear how each part connects | Broke into smaller debug/test steps |
| Added `"AUD_USD"` to pair list | This key doesn‚Äôt exist in JSON | Handled missing data gracefully with fallback logic |

---

## üìÖ 9 August 2025  
**Task ID:** AIVA-14  
**Title:** Add trend logic to determine convert/wait  
**Epic:** FX Data & API Layer  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed  

---

### üß† Objective  
Add percentage-based threshold logic to the FX trend analysis so the AI can recommend either "Convert Now" or "Wait" depending on market movement size.

---

### üóÇ Step-by-Step Process  

1. **Reviewed yesterday‚Äôs progress** from AIVA-13 & AIVA-11 to ensure base FX analysis logic was ready.  
2. **Created `fx_trend_with_threshold.py`** in `/ai/`.  
3. **Set threshold logic**:  
   - If drop ‚â• threshold ‚Üí **Convert Now**  
   - If small movement ‚Üí **Wait**  
4. **Initial run failed**:  
   - Reason: Python could not find script (`No such file or directory`)  
   - Cause: Repo had been moved from `Desktop` to `Documents/GitHub/`  
   - Fix: Navigated to correct path in terminal (`cd ~/Documents/GitHub/aiva-glow-wallet`)  
5. **File not found error for script**:  
   - Cause: File still in old Desktop folder  
   - Fix: Moved file into `/ai/` inside repo  
6. **Tested script with mock data** in `/fx_data/fxrates.json`.  
7. **Observed missing AUD_USD data**:  
   - Added graceful handling with `"N/A"` output to avoid crash.  

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Table  

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix |
|-------|------------|-----|
| Script not found | Running in wrong directory | Navigated to repo folder in Documents |
| Python path error | File created outside repo | Moved script into correct `/ai/` directory |
| Missing AUD_USD key | Not present in fxrates.json | Added "N/A" handling logic |

---

### üì∏ Output Screenshot  
Stored as `/screenshots/screenshot_aiva14_threshold_output.png`:

USD_AUD: falling (-1.32%) ‚Üí Convert Now | USD weakening vs AUD | Consider holding AUD

## üìÖ 11 August 2025  
**Task ID:** AIVA-14 (Enhancement)  
**Title:** Enhance FX trend analysis with debug output & flexible threshold input  
**Epic:** FX Data & API Layer  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed  

---

### üß† Objective  
Improve the FX trend analysis script (`fx_trend_with_threshold.py`) to make it easier to debug, test, and adjust decision logic by adding detailed printouts and a variable threshold via CLI.

---

### üóÇ Step-by-Step Process

2. **Added debug prints**:  
   - Data type (`OrderedDict`)  
   - List of available dates  
   - Sample day values with currency pairs and rates  
3. **Printed full currency series** for each pair with a flag indicating if any days are missing.  
4. **Allowed CLI argument** to set decision threshold:  
   - Example: `python3 ai/fx_trend_with_threshold.py 0.5` for 0.5% threshold  
   - Defaults to 1.0% if not specified.  
5. **Formatted outputs** to clearly show:  
   - Currency pair  
   - Trend direction & % change  
   - Decision: "Convert Now", "Wait", or "Hold position"  
6. **Tested script** with thresholds 0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.0% to confirm dynamic behaviour.

## üìÖ 15 August 2025
**Task ID:** AIVA-15  
**Title:** Simulate FX conversions with mock balances  
**Epic:** Smart FX AI Engine ‚Üí FX Data & API Layer  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed

---

### üß† Objective
Simulate FX conversions between **USD/EUR/AUD** using the latest rate from `fxrates.json`, persist balances in `balances.json`, and print a clear before/after summary. Handle missing pairs via inverses/cross rates and validate sufficient funds.

---

### ‚úÖ Steps Completed
1. **Created balances file**
   - `fx_data/balances.json` with starting balances (USD, EUR, AUD).
2. **Added simulation script**
   - `ai/fx_conversion_sim.py`:
     - Loads latest date from `fxrates.json`.
     - Gets direct rate or computes **inverse/cross via AUD**.
     - Validates inputs and available balance.
     - Updates and saves balances after conversion.
3. **Tested scenarios**
   - `USD ‚Üí AUD` (direct).
   - `AUD ‚Üí EUR` (cross via AUD).
   - Verified **insufficient funds** error path.
4. **Verified persistence**
   - Re-running shows updated balances in `fx_data/balances.json`.

---

### üõ† Troubleshooting & Fixes

# üìò Aiva Glow Wallet ‚Äì Logbook  
**Date:** 18 August 2025  
**Focus:** AIVA-15 ‚Äî Simulate FX conversion using mock data (with Green FX + Compliance stubs)

---

## üéØ Objective
Build a tiny end-to-end ‚Äúconversion‚Äù pipeline that:
- Keeps in-memory **balances** (AUD / USD / EUR).  
- Converts using **mock FX rates**.  
- Logs each conversion with a **carbon estimate** (Green FX badge source) and a **compliance status** (‚ÄúClear‚Äù / ‚ÄúReview Needed‚Äù).  

This gives us a safe playground to later plug into the UI card and the collapsible Compliance panel.

fx_data/
(no change today)


---

## üõ† What I built

### 1) `fx_simulation.py` (final structure)

Key sections in order (the order matters in Python!):

1. **balances** ‚Äì starting money per currency  
2. **fx_rates** ‚Äì mock rates for the pairs we use  
3. **carbon_factors** ‚Äì kg CO‚ÇÇ per 1000 units converted  
4. **transactions** ‚Äì in-memory log list  
5. **compliance_check(amount, from_cur, to_cur)** ‚Äì returns `"Review Needed"` if amount > 10,000, else `"Clear"`  
6. **log_transaction(...)** ‚Äì appends to `transactions` with carbon + compliance  
7. **convert(amount, from_cur, to_cur)** ‚Äì checks rate & funds, updates balances, calls `log_transaction`  
8. **test runs** ‚Äì prints initial balances, runs two conversions, prints all transactions  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Why order matters?  
> Python must **see** a function before it is called.  
> If `convert()` calls `log_transaction()`, then `log_transaction()` must be defined **above** `convert()` in the file.

---

### 2) How to run it
From your repo root:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/aiva-glow-wallet/ai
python3 fx_simulation.py

Expected output (shape):

Initial Balances: {'AUD': 1000.0, 'USD': 500.0, 'EUR': 300.0}
Converted 100 AUD ‚Üí 66.00 USD
Logged Transaction: { from: 'AUD', to: 'USD', amount: 100, converted: 66.0, carbon: '0.xx kg CO‚ÇÇ', compliance: 'Clear' }
Converted 200 USD ‚Üí 182.00 EUR
Logged Transaction: { from: 'USD', to: 'EUR', amount: 200, converted: 182.0, carbon: '0.xx kg CO‚ÇÇ', compliance: 'Clear' }
All Transactions: [ ...two entries... ]

üß® Bug I hit & how I fixed it

Error:
NameError: name 'log_transaction' is not defined

Root cause:
convert() was above log_transaction() in the file; Python hadn‚Äôt parsed log_transaction() yet when it was called.

Fix:
Reordered the file so log_transaction() is defined before convert().
This is a classic Python rule: definitions must appear before first use.

‚úÖ Verification checklist (what I confirmed)

 Balances update correctly after each conversion.

 Each transaction logs a carbon estimate using carbon_factors.

 Compliance returns "Clear" for small amounts (‚â§ 10,000).

 Output prints updated balances and a final transactions list.

 Running the script from ai/ works with python3 fx_simulation.py.

üß† What I learned (today)

Function order matters in Python. If A calls B, define B before A.

A minimal simulation can be powerful: balances ‚Üí convert ‚Üí log ‚Üí annotate with carbon & compliance.

Keeping concerns separated (rates, balances, estimators, compliance) makes later UI wiring simple.

üß™ Sample output interpretation (why it matters)

Carbon (e.g., ‚Äú0.42 kg CO‚ÇÇ‚Äù) comes from:
carbon_estimate = (amount / 1000) * carbon_factor[(from, to)]


This is the number we surface as the Green FX badge.

Compliance status ("Clear" vs "Review Needed") will drive the label on the
Compliance & Risk collapsible panel in the UI (e.g., ‚ÄúStatus: Review‚Äù).

üîÅ Next steps (tomorrow)

Hook the simulation outputs to the UI copy (Lovable content):

Show the Green FX badge value next to the Smart FX card.

Set the Compliance panel chip based on the latest transaction status.

Add a couple more pairs/rates & try a "Review Needed" case (e.g., amount > 10000) to see the panel flip.

(Optional) Persist transactions to a small JSON file for a simple history view.

1. **Set up `fx_conversion_sim.py`:**  
   - Created a CLI script to simulate FX conversions.  
   - Script loads latest rates from `fx_data/fxrates.json`.  
   - Loads balances from `fx_data/balances.json`.  

2. **Implemented conversion logic:**  
   - Deducts amount from source balance.  
   - Adds converted amount to destination balance.  
   - Prevents insufficient fund transfers.  

3. **Rate calculation:**  
   - Supports direct pairs (`USD_AUD`, `EUR_AUD`).  
   - Supports inverse pairs (e.g., `AUD_USD`).  
   - Supports cross rates via AUD pivot (e.g., `USD_EUR`).  

4. **Carbon estimation:**  
   - `estimate_carbon_kg()` calculates emissions in kg CO‚ÇÇ.  
   - Adds **Low/Medium/High** badge depending on thresholds.  

5. **Compliance check:**  
   - Transactions >10,000 flagged as `"Review Needed"`.  
   - Normal transactions marked `"Clear"`.  

6. **Test run in terminal:**  
   ```bash
   python3 ai/fx_conversion_sim.py USD AUD 200

‚úÖ Successfully converted USD ‚Üí AUD, updated balances, printed carbon + compliance tags.
