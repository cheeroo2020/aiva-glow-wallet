**Task ID:** AIVA-11  
**Title:** Test FX trend data with GPT response  
**Epic:** Smart FX AI Engine  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed  

---

#### üß† Objective  
Implement a Python script that reads mock FX rate data, detects 7-day trends, and outputs Smart FX-style conversion recommendations for selected currency pairs.

---

#### ‚úÖ Steps Completed

1. Opened AIVA-11 task to analyse FX trend using GPT-style logic.
2. Created directory structure:  
   - `fx_data/` for storing JSON rate files  
   - `ai/` for placing Python analysis scripts  
3. Created `fxrates.json` using 7-day sample data manually inside `fx_data/`.
4. Wrote `fx_trend_analysis.py` in `ai/` to:
   - Read `fxrates.json`
   - Extract currency pair values
   - Analyse whether the trend was rising, falling, or stable
   - Generate natural language suggestions
5. Ran into the following **issues** and fixed them step-by-step:

#### üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting and Fixes

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix |
|------|------------|-----|
| `cd path/to/your/aiva-glow-wallet` fails | Placeholder path not replaced | Used actual local repo path (`~/Desktop/aiva-glow-wallet`) |
| `FileNotFoundError` on `fxrates.json` | File didn‚Äôt exist yet | Created file using `touch fx_data/fxrates.json` |
| `fxrates.json` not found again | Wrong relative path | Ensured it was located inside `fx_data/` and referenced correctly from `ai/` |
| KeyError: `'USD_AUD'` | Tried to access pair as top-level key | Realised JSON had dates as top-level keys, each containing pairs |
| IndentationError after `for` loop | Block not indented | Properly indented the loop block |
| Confusion on logic order | Was unclear how each part connects | Broke into smaller debug/test steps |
| Added `"AUD_USD"` to pair list | This key doesn‚Äôt exist in JSON | Handled missing data gracefully with fallback logic |

---

## üìÖ 9 August 2025  
**Task ID:** AIVA-14  
**Title:** Add trend logic to determine convert/wait  
**Epic:** FX Data & API Layer  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed  

---

### üß† Objective  
Add percentage-based threshold logic to the FX trend analysis so the AI can recommend either "Convert Now" or "Wait" depending on market movement size.

---

### üóÇ Step-by-Step Process  

1. **Reviewed yesterday‚Äôs progress** from AIVA-13 & AIVA-11 to ensure base FX analysis logic was ready.  
2. **Created `fx_trend_with_threshold.py`** in `/ai/`.  
3. **Set threshold logic**:  
   - If drop ‚â• threshold ‚Üí **Convert Now**  
   - If small movement ‚Üí **Wait**  
4. **Initial run failed**:  
   - Reason: Python could not find script (`No such file or directory`)  
   - Cause: Repo had been moved from `Desktop` to `Documents/GitHub/`  
   - Fix: Navigated to correct path in terminal (`cd ~/Documents/GitHub/aiva-glow-wallet`)  
5. **File not found error for script**:  
   - Cause: File still in old Desktop folder  
   - Fix: Moved file into `/ai/` inside repo  
6. **Tested script with mock data** in `/fx_data/fxrates.json`.  
7. **Observed missing AUD_USD data**:  
   - Added graceful handling with `"N/A"` output to avoid crash.  

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Table  

| Issue | Root Cause | Fix |
|-------|------------|-----|
| Script not found | Running in wrong directory | Navigated to repo folder in Documents |
| Python path error | File created outside repo | Moved script into correct `/ai/` directory |
| Missing AUD_USD key | Not present in fxrates.json | Added "N/A" handling logic |

---

### üì∏ Output Screenshot  
Stored as `/screenshots/screenshot_aiva14_threshold_output.png`:

USD_AUD: falling (-1.32%) ‚Üí Convert Now | USD weakening vs AUD | Consider holding AUD

## üìÖ 11 August 2025  
**Task ID:** AIVA-14 (Enhancement)  
**Title:** Enhance FX trend analysis with debug output & flexible threshold input  
**Epic:** FX Data & API Layer  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed  

---

### üß† Objective  
Improve the FX trend analysis script (`fx_trend_with_threshold.py`) to make it easier to debug, test, and adjust decision logic by adding detailed printouts and a variable threshold via CLI.

---

### üóÇ Step-by-Step Process

2. **Added debug prints**:  
   - Data type (`OrderedDict`)  
   - List of available dates  
   - Sample day values with currency pairs and rates  
3. **Printed full currency series** for each pair with a flag indicating if any days are missing.  
4. **Allowed CLI argument** to set decision threshold:  
   - Example: `python3 ai/fx_trend_with_threshold.py 0.5` for 0.5% threshold  
   - Defaults to 1.0% if not specified.  
5. **Formatted outputs** to clearly show:  
   - Currency pair  
   - Trend direction & % change  
   - Decision: "Convert Now", "Wait", or "Hold position"  
6. **Tested script** with thresholds 0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.0% to confirm dynamic behaviour.

## üìÖ 15 August 2025
**Task ID:** AIVA-15  
**Title:** Simulate FX conversions with mock balances  
**Epic:** Smart FX AI Engine ‚Üí FX Data & API Layer  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed

---

### üß† Objective
Simulate FX conversions between **USD/EUR/AUD** using the latest rate from `fxrates.json`, persist balances in `balances.json`, and print a clear before/after summary. Handle missing pairs via inverses/cross rates and validate sufficient funds.

---

### ‚úÖ Steps Completed
1. **Created balances file**
   - `fx_data/balances.json` with starting balances (USD, EUR, AUD).
2. **Added simulation script**
   - `ai/fx_conversion_sim.py`:
     - Loads latest date from `fxrates.json`.
     - Gets direct rate or computes **inverse/cross via AUD**.
     - Validates inputs and available balance.
     - Updates and saves balances after conversion.
3. **Tested scenarios**
   - `USD ‚Üí AUD` (direct).
   - `AUD ‚Üí EUR` (cross via AUD).
   - Verified **insufficient funds** error path.
4. **Verified persistence**
   - Re-running shows updated balances in `fx_data/balances.json`.

---

### üõ† Troubleshooting & Fixes

# üìò Aiva Glow Wallet ‚Äì Logbook  
**Date:** 18 August 2025  
**Focus:** AIVA-15 ‚Äî Simulate FX conversion using mock data (with Green FX + Compliance stubs)

---

## üéØ Objective
Build a tiny end-to-end ‚Äúconversion‚Äù pipeline that:
- Keeps in-memory **balances** (AUD / USD / EUR).  
- Converts using **mock FX rates**.  
- Logs each conversion with a **carbon estimate** (Green FX badge source) and a **compliance status** (‚ÄúClear‚Äù / ‚ÄúReview Needed‚Äù).  

This gives us a safe playground to later plug into the UI card and the collapsible Compliance panel.

fx_data/
(no change today)


---

## üõ† What I built

### 1) `fx_simulation.py` (final structure)

Key sections in order (the order matters in Python!):

1. **balances** ‚Äì starting money per currency  
2. **fx_rates** ‚Äì mock rates for the pairs we use  
3. **carbon_factors** ‚Äì kg CO‚ÇÇ per 1000 units converted  
4. **transactions** ‚Äì in-memory log list  
5. **compliance_check(amount, from_cur, to_cur)** ‚Äì returns `"Review Needed"` if amount > 10,000, else `"Clear"`  
6. **log_transaction(...)** ‚Äì appends to `transactions` with carbon + compliance  
7. **convert(amount, from_cur, to_cur)** ‚Äì checks rate & funds, updates balances, calls `log_transaction`  
8. **test runs** ‚Äì prints initial balances, runs two conversions, prints all transactions  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Why order matters?  
> Python must **see** a function before it is called.  
> If `convert()` calls `log_transaction()`, then `log_transaction()` must be defined **above** `convert()` in the file.

---

### 2) How to run it
From your repo root:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/aiva-glow-wallet/ai
python3 fx_simulation.py

Expected output (shape):

Initial Balances: {'AUD': 1000.0, 'USD': 500.0, 'EUR': 300.0}
Converted 100 AUD ‚Üí 66.00 USD
Logged Transaction: { from: 'AUD', to: 'USD', amount: 100, converted: 66.0, carbon: '0.xx kg CO‚ÇÇ', compliance: 'Clear' }
Converted 200 USD ‚Üí 182.00 EUR
Logged Transaction: { from: 'USD', to: 'EUR', amount: 200, converted: 182.0, carbon: '0.xx kg CO‚ÇÇ', compliance: 'Clear' }
All Transactions: [ ...two entries... ]

üß® Bug I hit & how I fixed it

Error:
NameError: name 'log_transaction' is not defined

Root cause:
convert() was above log_transaction() in the file; Python hadn‚Äôt parsed log_transaction() yet when it was called.

Fix:
Reordered the file so log_transaction() is defined before convert().
This is a classic Python rule: definitions must appear before first use.

‚úÖ Verification checklist (what I confirmed)

 Balances update correctly after each conversion.

 Each transaction logs a carbon estimate using carbon_factors.

 Compliance returns "Clear" for small amounts (‚â§ 10,000).

 Output prints updated balances and a final transactions list.

 Running the script from ai/ works with python3 fx_simulation.py.

üß† What I learned (today)

Function order matters in Python. If A calls B, define B before A.

A minimal simulation can be powerful: balances ‚Üí convert ‚Üí log ‚Üí annotate with carbon & compliance.

Keeping concerns separated (rates, balances, estimators, compliance) makes later UI wiring simple.

üß™ Sample output interpretation (why it matters)

Carbon (e.g., ‚Äú0.42 kg CO‚ÇÇ‚Äù) comes from:
carbon_estimate = (amount / 1000) * carbon_factor[(from, to)]


This is the number we surface as the Green FX badge.

Compliance status ("Clear" vs "Review Needed") will drive the label on the
Compliance & Risk collapsible panel in the UI (e.g., ‚ÄúStatus: Review‚Äù).

üîÅ Next steps (tomorrow)

Hook the simulation outputs to the UI copy (Lovable content):

Show the Green FX badge value next to the Smart FX card.

Set the Compliance panel chip based on the latest transaction status.

Add a couple more pairs/rates & try a "Review Needed" case (e.g., amount > 10000) to see the panel flip.

(Optional) Persist transactions to a small JSON file for a simple history view.

   - Script loads latest rates from `fx_data/fxrates.json`.  
   - Loads balances from `fx_data/balances.json`.  

2. **Implemented conversion logic:**  
   - Deducts amount from source balance.  
   - Adds converted amount to destination balance.  
   - Prevents insufficient fund transfers.  

3. **Rate calculation:**  
   - Supports direct pairs (`USD_AUD`, `EUR_AUD`).  
   - Supports inverse pairs (e.g., `AUD_USD`).  
   - Supports cross rates via AUD pivot (e.g., `USD_EUR`).  

4. **Carbon estimation:**  
   - `estimate_carbon_kg()` calculates emissions in kg CO‚ÇÇ.  
   - Adds **Low/Medium/High** badge depending on thresholds.  

5. **Compliance check:**  
   - Transactions >10,000 flagged as `"Review Needed"`.  
   - Normal transactions marked `"Clear"`.  

6. **Test run in terminal:**  
   ```bash
   python3 ai/fx_conversion_sim.py USD AUD 200

‚úÖ Successfully converted USD ‚Üí AUD, updated balances, printed carbon + compliance tags.

# üìÖ 25 August 2025 ‚Äî Logbook (Sprint 2)

**Focus:** Practice and validate the FX conversion simulator with carbon + compliance stubs.  
**Repo path:** `~/Documents/GitHub/aiva-glow-wallet`

---

## ‚úÖ What I did
1. Ensured a transactions file exists (empty array if missing).
   ```bash
   [[ -f fx_data/transactions_sample.json ]] || echo "[]" > fx_data/transactions_sample.json
   ```
2. Ran the simulator with a few scenarios to learn balance checks, rate lookup, carbon estimate, and compliance flow.

---

## üß™ Runs & Results

### 1) Attempted: USD ‚Üí AUD, 200  
```bash
python3 ai/fx_conversion_sim.py USD AUD 200
```
**Outcome:** ‚ùå `ValueError: Insufficient USD balance`  
> Lesson: balance validation happens **before** compliance.

---

### 2) Successful small trade: EUR ‚Üí USD, 50  
```bash
python3 ai/fx_conversion_sim.py EUR USD 50
```

**Expected-style output (abridged):**
```
[FX Conversion Simulation]
Date used: 2025-08-07
Rate EUR->USD: 1.073333
Amount: 50.00 EUR  ‚Üí  53.67 USD

Before:
  USD 100.00 | EUR 986.34 | AUD 2,550.00

After:
  USD 153.67 | EUR 936.34 | AUD 2,550.00

Impact & Controls:
  Carbon: 0.03 kg CO‚ÇÇ (Low)  |  Compliance: Clear
```

---

### 3) Compliance test (large trade): USD ‚Üí AUD, 15,000  
```bash
python3 ai/fx_conversion_sim.py USD AUD 15000
```
- First try: ‚ùå Failed (insufficient USD balance).  
- After topping up balances (or using a smaller amount): ‚úÖ success and **Compliance: Review** triggered.

**One‚Äëliner style (example):**
```
USD->AUD @ 1.5000 | 15,000.00 USD ‚Üí 22,500.00 AUD | CO‚ÇÇ 6.30 kg CO‚ÇÇ (High) | Review
```

> Note: Exact carbon value depends on your `fx_data/carbon_factors.json`.

---

## üì∏ Key Outputs (recap)
- **Small trade (EUR‚ÜíUSD 50)** ‚Üí Carbon **0.03 kg (Low)**, Compliance **Clear**, balances updated correctly.  
- **Large trade (USD‚ÜíAUD 15,000)** ‚Üí Carbon **High**, Compliance **Review** (after ensuring sufficient source funds).

## üßØ Problems & Fixes

| Problem                          | Cause                            | Fix (short)                                 |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Insufficient balance error       | Amount > available funds         | Top up `balances.json` or reduce amount     |
| Compliance not triggered         | Amount below threshold           | Use higher amount (e.g., 15,000 USD)        |
| Confused order of validations    | Expected compliance before funds | Remember: **Funds ‚Üí Rate ‚Üí Carbon ‚Üí Compliance** |

---

## üß† Learnings
- Validation order (very important):  
  1. **Balance sufficiency**  
  2. **FX rate calculation** (direct, inverse, AUD cross)  
  3. **Carbon estimate** (factor per 1000 units)  
  4. **Compliance** (simple threshold ‚Üí `Clear` / `Review`)
- Debugging approach:
  - Read Python tracebacks (`ValueError`) carefully
  - Start with small, controlled trades
  - Adjust JSON data (`balances.json`, `carbon_factors.json`) when needed

---

## üóÇ Files touched today
- `ai/fx_conversion_sim.py` (run + verify behavior)
- `fx_data/balances.json` (adjust for tests)
- `fx_data/transactions_sample.json` (append tx logs)
- `fx_data/carbon_factors.json` (used in estimate)

---

## ‚úÖ Commit for today

**Commit message**
```
AIVA-15/S2: Exercise FX simulator with carbon & compliance cases
```

**Extended description**
```
- Ran fx_conversion_sim.py with small and large trades
- Verified balance checks, rate lookup, carbon estimate, and compliance flow
- Confirmed "Clear" for small trade and "Review" for high-value trade
- Ensured transactions_sample.json appends correctly; balances.json updated
```

---

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next steps (Sprint 2 goals)
- Add one screenshot to `/screenshots/` for each scenario (small trade, compliance review).
- Link the simulator ‚Äúone-liner‚Äù output into the **Smart FX** UI card mock (Lovable).
- Prepare a tiny function to read the latest transaction from `transactions_sample.json` for UI.

---

## 31 August 2025  
**Task ID:** AIVA-17, AIVA-18, AIVA-19 (Sprint 2 Wrap-up)  
**Epic:** Documentation & GitHub / FX Data & API Layer  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed  

---

### üéØ Objective  
Finish Sprint 2 with a **working demo of FX conversion simulation** that:  
- Updates balances from `balances.json`  
- Uses latest FX rates (`fxrates.json`)  
- Estimates carbon footprint per trade (`carbon_factors.json`)  
- Runs a compliance stub for large trades  
- Appends transactions into `transactions_sample.json`  

---

### üìù Step-by-Step Process  

1. **Balance Setup**  
   - Initial error when running `USD‚ÜíAUD 15000`:  
     ```
     ValueError: Insufficient USD balance. Have 5053.67, need 15000.0
     ```  
   - ‚úÖ Fixed by resetting balances.json to:  
     ```json
     {"USD":20000,"EUR":1000,"AUD":1000}
     ```  

2. **Small Trade Test** (`EUR‚ÜíUSD 50`)  
   - Output confirmed:  
     ```
     Before:  USD 100.00 | EUR 986.34 | AUD 2,550.00
     After:   USD 153.67 | EUR 936.34 | AUD 2,550.00
     Carbon:  0.03 kg CO‚ÇÇ (Low) | Compliance: Clear
     ```  
   - Verified **FX rate lookup**, **balances update**, **carbon = Low**, and **compliance = Clear**.  

3. **Large Trade Test** (`USD‚ÜíAUD 15000`)  
   - After fixing balances:  
     ```
     Before:  USD 20,000.00 | EUR 1,000.00 | AUD 1,000.00
     After:   USD 5,000.00  | EUR 1,000.00 | AUD 23,500.00
     Carbon:  6.30 kg CO‚ÇÇ (High) | Compliance: Review
     ```  
   - ‚úÖ Compliance correctly triggered for >10,000 USD.  
   - ‚úÖ Carbon footprint correctly classified as **High**.  

4. **Transaction Logging**  
   - Each trade appended to `fx_data/transactions_sample.json` with:  
     - Timestamp  
     - Pair, rate, amount  
     - Before/After balances  
     - Carbon + Compliance results  

---

### üì∏ Key Outputs  

#### ‚úÖ Successful Small Trade (EUR‚ÜíUSD 50)  
- Carbon footprint: `0.03 kg CO‚ÇÇ (Low)`  
- Compliance: `Clear`  

#### ‚úÖ Successful Large Trade (USD‚ÜíAUD 15000)  
- Carbon footprint: `6.3 kg CO‚ÇÇ (High)`  
- Compliance: `Review`  

---

### üö© Problems & Fixes  

| Problem                         | Cause                           | Solution                                      |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Insufficient balance error       | Tried to trade more than wallet | Reset or topped up `balances.json`            |
| Compliance not triggered         | Trade was too small             | Tested with 15,000 USD, crossed threshold     |
| Confusion: balance vs compliance | Script enforces balances first  | Learned order: Balance ‚Üí FX ‚Üí Carbon ‚Üí Comp.  |

---

### üìö Learnings  
- **Order of execution matters**:  
  1. Balance sufficiency check  
  2. FX rate calculation  
  3. Carbon estimation  
  4. Compliance review  

- Debugging was systematic:  
  - Read `ValueError` tracebacks  
  - Tested smaller trades first  
  - Adjusted `balances.json` when needed  

- Adding **carbon + compliance layers** makes the wallet simulation feel closer to a real fintech engine.  

---

### ‚úÖ Outcome  
- Sprint 2 deliverables finished.  
- **FX Conversion Simulator** working with balances, carbon tags, compliance stub, and transaction logging.  
- Ready to move into **Sprint 3 (Compliance Epic, Sep 1)**.  

---

## üìÖ 2 September 2025  
**Focus:** Mapping Global Licensing Insights into Sprint Structure  
**Context:** Lessons from Airwallex global licensing snapshot applied to Aiva Epics  

---

### üîó Mapping Regulatory Learnings to Aiva Sprint Structure  

#### 1. Compliance & Risk Epic  
- **Insight:** Each region (AUSTRAC, FinCEN, FCA, EBA) mandates AML/CTF checks, reporting, and transaction monitoring.  
- **Sprint Link:**  
  - **AIVA-46 (KYC/AML onboarding flow):** Simulate AUSTRAC/FinCEN KYC tiers (basic vs enhanced).  
  - **AIVA-47 (Compliance checklist):** Align with PSD2 obligations (EU) vs MSB obligations (US).  
  - **AIVA-48 (Audit trail):** Logs must satisfy potential regulator reviews (AUSTRAC/FinCEN examiners).  

---

#### 2. FX Data & API Layer  
- **Insight:** Regulators separate processors (no wallet balances) vs transmitters (holding balances). Licensing depends on handling customer funds.  
- **Sprint Link:**  
  - **AIVA-19 (Mockdata & AI folders):** Extend mock FX data with jurisdiction tags.  
  - **AIVA-15 (Conversion simulation):** Add ‚Äújurisdiction‚Äù metadata to each simulated transaction.  
  - **Future:** Wrap all FX API calls with compliance hooks for reporting.  

---

#### 3. Wallet UI  
- **Insight:** Consumer protection varies (FCA e-money safeguarding vs ASIC AFSL disclosure).  
- **Sprint Link:**  
  - **AIVA-4/5/6 (UI tasks):** Display disclosure banners (‚ÄúDemo only, not licensed provider‚Äù).  
  - **Future:** Toggle UI between ASIC vs FCA reporting mockups.  

---

#### 4. Documentation & GitHub  
- **Insight:** Regulators expect policies and privacy compliance docs in addition to technical systems.  
- **Sprint Link:**  
  - **AIVA-18 (README.md):** Add a ‚ÄúLicensing Snapshot‚Äù section documenting obligations.  
  - **AIVA-49 (Data policy to APPs):** Map directly to Australian Privacy Principles (APPs).  

---

#### 5. Demo & Launch  
- **Insight:** Firms expand region by region ‚Äî not everywhere at once.  
- **Sprint Link:**  
  - **AIVA-21 (Milestone dates):** Simulate a staged rollout (AU ‚Üí UK ‚Üí US).  
  - **AIVA-22 (Pitch deck):** Show compliance maturity as part of expansion plan.  

---

### ‚úÖ Learnings  
- Regulation is part of the product, not an afterthought.  
- Compliance epics map neatly to global case studies (Airwallex, Wise, Stripe).  
- For Aiva, even as a prototype, adding ‚Äújurisdiction-aware‚Äù tags makes the simulation closer to a real-world wallet.  

---

### üìå Next Steps  
- Add ‚ÄúLicensing Insights Layer‚Äù to **logbook.md** to guide Sprint 3 (Compliance Epic).  
- Update README to include a **Licensing Snapshot section**.  
- Begin Sprint 3 with AUSTRAC-inspired KYC/AML onboarding simulation.

### Branch Setup
Created and switched to new branch `sprint3/compliance` in GitHub website. Verified sync with GitHub Desktop and confirmed branch alignment.

### Audit Log
Scaffolded `fx_data/audit_log.json` for compliance event tracking. Prepared structure for recording blocked/reviewed/cleared transactions.

### Compliance Logic
Upgraded `ai/fx_conversion_sim.py` with compliance rules: amount thresholds, velocity checks (structuring), and sanctions mock. Added full compliance object (`status`, `reason`, `rules_triggered`).

### Audit Integration
Implemented `append_audit` to record structured audit events into `audit_log.json`.

### UI Work (Lovable)
Prepared a single comprehensive Lovable prompt to modernize wallet UI: dark mode toggle, collapsible compliance panel, transaction timeline, AI insight card, and improved balance cards.

### Sync & Confirmation
Confirmed branch state in GitHub Desktop and verified no local changes pending. Repository is aligned with remote `sprint3/compliance`.

### Next Steps
Tomorrow: extend compliance UI in Lovable, finalize Sprint 3 commits, and begin planning for Sprint 4 API layer.

---

**Date:** Monday, 08 September 2025

---

### Compliance Engine
- Enhanced `ai/fx_conversion_sim.py` with full compliance logic.
- Implemented thresholds: >10,000 flagged as Review, >50,000 flagged as Blocked.
- Added velocity detection (‚â•3 transactions in 60 seconds).
- Included sanctions mock for blocked currency pairs.

### Transaction Log Enrichment
- All entries now saved into `fx_data/transactions_log.json`.
- Each record includes:
  - Carbon object (`kg`, `badge`)
  - Compliance object (`status`, `reason`, `rules_triggered`)

### Audit Trail
- Created `fx_data/audit_log.json` for sensitive actions.
- Records both `conversion_attempt` (blocked) and `conversion_settled` (clear/review).

### Testing Outputs
- Verified Clear transactions (small amounts).
- Verified Review transactions (amounts >10,000).
- Verified Blocked transactions (amounts >50,000).
- Verified velocity detection by running ‚â•3 trades within 60s.

### Jira Updates
- Marked **AIVA-106 (Compliance Rule Engine)** as Done.
- Progressed **AIVA-48 (Audit Trail)** to In Progress.
- Prepared for **AIVA-50 (Compliance Alerts UI)** via Lovable integration next.

### Next Steps
- Hook enriched JSON into Lovable UI (timeline + collapsible compliance panel).
- Export screenshots of UI updates for Sprint 3 deliverables.
- Plan for Sprint 4 API endpoints (/balances, /convert, /transactions).
