| Task ID  | Title                                               | Status        |

| AIVA-47  | Velocity & Pattern Checks (structuring)             | ✅ Done       |
| AIVA-48  | Enrich transaction log with compliance metadata     | ⏳ In Progress|

| AIVA-106 | Implement compliance rule engine (thresholds, velocity, sanctions) | ✅ Done |

**Highlights Today (22 September 2025):**
- Refined **`ai/fx_conversion_sim.py`** with full compliance logic: threshold checks, velocity detection, and sanctions mock.  
- Integrated **audit logging** to `fx_data/audit_log.json` using a standardized writer (`write_audit`) and documented schema (`docs/audit_log_schema.md`).  
- CLI test runs: clear (small), review (>10k USD), blocked (>50k USD), and velocity (≥3 trades in 60s).  
- During large tests, insufficient balances triggered overdraft prevention as expected — captured in logbook.  
- Logbook updated for **22 Sep 2025**.  

---

## 🔄 Reset (1 Oct 2025)
- **New 90-day plan launched (Oct–Dec 2025).**
- Repo restructured with compliance-first focus:
  - `/compliance`, `/docs`, `/tests` created.  
  - Drafted **Mission.md** with 4 core pillars:  
    1. Borderless multi-currency wallet  
    2. Compliance-first design  
    3. Blockchain-anchored statements  
    4. AI-resistant, auditor-friendly exports  
- Logbook updated to mark reset milestone.  

---

## 🧠 Module Progress
1. **Wallet UI (/lovable_ui)**  
   - ✅ Dashboard, balances, FX converter, static log.  
   - ✅ Smart FX Recommendation with Green FX badge.  
   - ✅ Collapsible compliance panel.  
   - ⏳ Pending: compliance alerts, timeline transaction view, dark mode toggle.  

2. **Smart FX AI Engine (/ai)**

   - Thresholds, velocity, sanctions checks, and carbon estimation integrated.  

3. **FX Data Store (/fx_data)**  
   - `transactions_log.json` → enriched with compliance & carbon.

4. **Compliance (/compliance)**  
   - Reset structure added.  
   - `kyc_flow.md` scaffolded.  
   - `risk_log.json` scaffolded.  

5. **Docs (/docs)**

6. **Tests (/tests)**  
   - OCR and compliance test logs to be added (Nov 2025).

## 🧭 What’s Next
- Complete reset tasks: fill Mission.md, draft KYC flow, add first risk log.  
- Resume Sprint 3 compliance enrichment.  
- Begin Sprint 4 in October: FastAPI endpoints (`/convert`, `/balances`, `/transactions`).  
- Prototype Cloked Compliance: statement hashing + blockchain anchoring + cloaked exports.
